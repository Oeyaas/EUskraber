Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.

Conclusions  – 13 December 2019 
 

 

EUCO XT 20027/19    1 

   EN 
 

1. The European Council reiterates its commitment to an orderly withdrawal on the basis of the 

Withdrawal Agreement and calls for its timely ratification and effective implementation. 

2. The European Council reconfirms its desire to establish as close as possible a future 

relationship with the UK in line with the Political Declaration and respecting the previously 

agreed European Council’s guidelines, as well as statements and declarations, notably those 

of 25 November 2018. The future relationship will have to be based on a balance of rights and 

obligations and ensure a level playing field. 

3. To this end the European Council invites the Commission to submit to the Council a draft 

comprehensive mandate for a future relationship with the UK immediately after its 

withdrawal. It invites the General Affairs Council to adopt swiftly the relevant decisions and 

negotiating mandate. 

4. The European Council welcomes the Commission’s decision to reappoint Michel Barnier for 

the negotiations on the future relationship. The negotiations will continue to take place in a 

coherent manner and in unity and transparency with all Member States. The negotiations will 

be conducted in continuous coordination and permanent dialogue with the Council and its 

preparatory bodies. 

5. The European Council will follow negotiations closely and agree further general political 

directions as necessary. Between European Council meetings, the General Affairs Council 

and Coreper, assisted by a dedicated Working Party, will ensure that the negotiations are 

conducted in line with the overall positions and principles agreed by the European Council 

as well as the Council’s negotiating mandate, and provide further guidance as necessary fully 

consistent with the EU’s best interest and with the aim of reaching a result that is fair and 

equitable for all Member States and in the interest of our citizens.
